Description: This package performs robust hierarchical co-clustering between row and column entities of a data matrix
             by reducing the influence of outlying observations. It can be used to explore biomarker genes those are 
             divided into upregulatory and downregulatory groups by the influence of different chemical compounds groups 
             more accurately. It can also provide the statistical significance of the identified co-clusters. 
             See Hasan et al., (2020).
